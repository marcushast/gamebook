A very basic browser for "choose your own adventure" style books.

Currently books are defined in a simple XML and no features besides basic navigation and a very ugly UI are available.

The first commit is in horrible auto-converted Kotlin but is intended to be cleaned up to something a bit less atrocious as more features are added.

If you for some reason found this and want to play with it, feel free.
